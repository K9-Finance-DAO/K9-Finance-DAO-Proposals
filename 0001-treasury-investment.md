# Proposal Objectives and Benefits

This proposal seeks to outline a preliminary treasury investment strategy for K9 Finance DAO, to utilize the DAO's treasury assets to earn passive yield through low-risk DeFi strategies and investment in yield-bearing (YB) assets.

## Primary Objectives
The primary objectives of the proposal are to:
1. Immediately start earning yield on the DAO's treasury assets.
2. Align with the K9 Finance DAO brand story: promoting the benefits of Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) with a focus on Lido.
3. Begin discussions around building a framework for advising and governing future DAO investments and treasury management (see: [Looking Ahead - Investment Philosophy](#investment-philosophy)).

## Secondary Objectives and Benefits
1. Growth the DAO treasury, creating value for KNINE governance token holders.
2. Develop an "*Investment Philosophy*" with short-term and long-term treasury investment strategies that align with the DAO's mission and values.
3. Create risk profile and risk management framework for the DAO's treasury investments, including diversification and risk mitigation strategies, performance monitoring, and governance processes.
   - Focus on core web3 and investment principals like diversification, decentralization, and censorship resistance.
4. Promote the growth and long term sustainability of the Shibarium ecosystem, BONE token, SHIB token, and DeFi protocols on Shibarium.





# Background and Rationale
need to talk about:
- current treasury composition, and opportunity cost of not investing
- current risk appetite and preference to remain on the Ethereum mainnet
- liquidity needs

maybe include
- previous experiences and preferences
- technical capabilities
- current trends in treasury investment, DeFi, liquidity provision, LSDs and YB assets


## Current Treasury Composition

Here is an approximate breakdown of the DAO's treasury assets (excluding KNINE tokens) as of 2024-04-10:

| Asset                 | Amount (USD) | % of Treasury |
|-----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Ether (ETH)           | $450,000     | 45%           |
| Stablecoins           | $450,000     | 45%           |
| Other (BONE and SHIB) | $100,000     | 10%           |

## Risk Appetite
The DAO is very risk averse. We need to ***guard the treasury value to ensure sustainable, long-term development of the K9 Finance Protocol***, to protect and grow value for KNINE token holders.

The DAO will focus on low-risk, stable yield-generating assets and battle-tested DeFi strategies to align with the DAO's risk aversion and liquidity needs.

## Scope
This proposal is only recommending initial treasury investment strategies that utilize the Ether (ETH) and stablecoin portions of the treasury. Future proposals may consider utilizing the other assets.

It is being recommended that the DAO seek to roughly maintain the current treasury composition for primary assets, keeping ~50% in ETH (equivalents) and ~50% in stablecoins. This will maintain exposure to the upside potential or the market while hedging downside risks to maintain liquidity for operational expenses and unforeseen circumstances.




# Proposed Strategies for Yield Generation
The proposed treasury investment strategy will focus on three core strategies for yield generation:
  1. **Yield Bearing Assets**
  2. **Lending**
  3. **Liquidity Provision**

## Hold Yield Bearing Assets
YB assets are yield-bearing equivalents of underlying assets. For this proposal, the DAO will focus on Ethereum LSDs and staked stablecoins. These will allow for high, immediate liquidity, should any need arise.

In the future, the DAO should consider diversifying into fixed-yield assets through [Pendle Finance](https://www.pendle.finance/) that provide a higher, *predictable* yield. These assets are out of scope for this proposal due to the considerations needed around lockup time.

## Providing Liquidity (Lending) to Money Markets
This proposal recommends that the DAO provide liquidity to decentralized money markets like Aave and Compound. This will allow the DAO to earn interest on its stablecoin holdings while maintaining the ability to withdraw funds quickly if needed.

## Providing Liquidity to AMMs
TODO/TBD


## Proposed Investment Strategy Allocation Breakdown
As a starting point, this proposal is recommending that the DAO allocate the following portions of its ETH and stablecoins to these strategies to start earning yield. 

| Strategy                        | ~% of Treasury | Aprox. Allocation Value (USD) | 
|---------------------------------|:--------------:|------------------------------:|
| Hold Yield Bearing Assets       | 52.2%          | $470,000       |
| Lending                         | 44.4%          | $400,000       |
| Liquidity Provision             |  0.0%          | $0             |
|||
| *Total Invested*                | *96.67%*       | *$870,000*     |
| &nbsp; ||
| ETH Reserve                     | 3.33%          | $30,000        |
| USD Reserve                     | 0.00%          | $0             |
|||
| *Total Reserve*                 | *3.33%*        | *$30,000*      |
|&nbsp;||
|||
| **Total** (*ETH and USD*)                        | **100%**       | ***$900,000*** |
|||


A key consideration here is the desire to diversify the treasury's yield generation strategies, while simultaneously maintaining a focus on simplicity, low-risk, passive maintenance, and gas-efficiency.

# Risk Assessment and Management
The DAO is very risk averse. We need to ***protect the treasury to ensure the sustainable, long-term development of the K9 Finance Protocol***, ultimately protecting and growing value for KNINE token holders.

Over time, through this proposal and subsequent treasury management proposals, the DAO will be able to build a risk profile and alignment with an investment philosophy. This should include:
- risk categories with target investment weights
- risk evaluation criteria and monitoring processes (including KPIs and reporting standards)
- criteria for balancing treasury investments to meet the DAO's risk tolerance
- criteria for evaluating and considering non-financial value and impact of investments

TODO: write this section

# Financial Projections
TODO: add summary table

For a detailed breakdown of the full investment allocation breakdown, historical yields from the proposed strategies, and projected yields for the DAO's treasury, please refer to the financial projections in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yLlyyslOnAoQTEB_AELtvH69duklo5RpWjmbS_910NU/edit?usp=sharing). 

> [!WARNING] These projections are based on current market conditions and historical data. Actual returns will vary based on future market conditions, the performance of the DeFi protocols used, and other unforeseen circumstances.


> [!IMPORTANT] The DAO must regularly review and adjust its treasury investment strategies based on changing market conditions and the performance of the strategies.



# Looking Ahead
TODO: Briefly touch upon how the DAO envisages future expansions into more complex strategies, partnerships, and integrations. Emphasize that these are part of a long-term vision to further enhance yield generation, aligning with the DAO’s growth and risk management strategies.
   - liquid restaking protocols
   - ecosystem partnerships - treasury swaps
   - yield farming opportunities
   - leveraged yield farming

## Investment Philosophy
The DAO should begin developing an *Investment Philosophy* [^1^][1] to guide future treasury management that aligns with its mission and values, including criteria for evaluating and considering non-financial value and impact of investments.


This philosophy should guide the DAO's treasury investment decisions and help ensure that the treasury investments are in line with the DAO's goals and objectives.

1. **DAO's Mission and Values**:

   1. Generate passive yield on the DAO's treasury assets through DeFi strategies.
   2. Align with the K9 Finance DAO brand story: "liquid staking derivatives" with a focus on Lido.
   3. Create risk profile and reduce risk.
   4. Grow the Shibarium ecosystem, attract users and TVL, promote the growth of DeFi on Shibarium, and help grow value for the BONE token, SHIB token, and DeFi protocols on Shibarium.

   ## Background on K9 Finance DAO
   The DAO's core product is a Liquid Staking Derivative of the BONE token: **knBONE**. BONE is the primary token, powering the Shibarium blockchain. Shibarium is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain that is fully compatible with Ethereum. BONE is used as the gas token to pay for Shibarium transactions, as well as used to secure the proof-of-stake (PoS) network through validator staking and delegation.

   Liquid staking derivatives have become a core foundational element of the DeFi ecosystem and are a fundamental element for modern PoS blockchains. They unlock liquidity, creating yield-bearing assets (YB assets) that can further be used in DeFi protocols, while still helping secure the blockchain through delegated staking. 
   
   The K9 Finance DAO is working to bring this fundamental DeFi building block to the Shibarium L2:
   - increasing the security of the network
   - increasing the utility of the BONE token
   - providing a new DeFi primitive, knBONE, to the broader DeFi ecosystem 
   - driving the adoption of Shibarium and BONE
   - driving the growth of DeFi protocols on Shibarium
   



2. **Current Treasury Composition**:
   The DAO treasury currently holds approximately $1,000,000 in a mix of assets:
   - 45% Ether (ETH)
   - 45% stablecoins (USDC and USDT)
   - 10% Other (BONE and SHIB tokens)


3. **Risk Appetite**:
   The DAO is very risk averse. Over time, through this proposal and subsequent treasury management proposals, the DAO will be able to build a risk profile, risk categories with target investment weights, risk evaluation criteria and monitoring processes, and criteria for balancing treasury investments to meet the DAO's risk tolerance.

   For the initial treasury investment proposal, the DAO will focus on low-risk, stable yield-generating assets and battle-tested DeFi strategies.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   Liquidity needs are low. The DAO does not have immediate cash flow needs and can afford to lock up some of its treasury assets in yield-generating strategies; however, the DAO should maintain a portion of its treasury in liquid assets to cover operational expenses and unforeseen circumstances.

   For the initial treasury investment proposal, the DAO will focus only on highly liquid assets or strategies that allow for quick redemption. Future proposals may consider longer lock-up periods for higher yield opportunities.

4. **Governance and Decision-making**:
   The DAO currently makes decisions regarding treasury management through a decentralized governance process, where token holders can vote on proposals. The treasury investment proposal will be submitted as a governance proposal for token holders to vote on.

5. **Previous Experiences and Preferences**:
   No. The DAO has not previously engaged in yield-generating strategies. This is the first treasury investment proposal for the DAO.

6. **Regulatory Considerations**:
   The DAO is based in Panama and is subject to Panamanian laws and regulations. The DAO will comply with all applicable laws and regulations when engaging in yield-generating activities; however, our legal team has advised that the DAO is not subject to any specific regulatory constraints that would prevent it from engaging in DeFi strategies.

7. **Technical Capabilities**:
   The DAO has an elected management council that oversees treasury management. This team has members with high levels of technical expertise and long history of combining DeFi strategies to create complex yield boosting strategies. We are very competent.


Integration with Shibarium and the Broader DeFi Ecosystem: Since a key part of K9 Finance DAO's mission is to grow the Shibarium ecosystem and attract users and TVL, do you envision any specific collaborations or integrations with other projects on Shibarium or within the broader Ethereum ecosystem? Understanding any planned or potential partnerships can help highlight opportunities for synergy in the proposal, especially in terms of driving adoption and utility for knBONE and other Shibarium-based DeFi protocols.

This is a great question. We are actively working on partnerships and integrations with other projects on Shibarium and within the broader Ethereum ecosystem; and this will definitely be a key part of our *future* treasury investment strategy; however, for the initial treasury investment proposal, we are only focusing on low-risk ways to start earning yield on the DAO treasury's assets.

# Recommended Approach
treasury.k9safe.eth

My thoughts on where we should put the treasury is two fold:
1. One is making money
2. The other is brand story.
3.
4. Our brand story is that we’re big on Lido and liquid staking. So we should walk the walk there. But I’m sure we can also take some more risk with curve as well maybe their 3pool on Curve for stables

Requirements for Treasury Plan Proposal:

- Steps (swap ETH into Lido for example)
- Yield farming opportunity
- Stablecoins on Convex / Aura 
- Timeline 
- Expected yield, any lockups, what process redeeming
- Why we're using this, other treasuries that use this 
- How we are removing smart contract risk, but what risks are there 
- Amount we're going to be using, how this fits into our overall budgeting, are there any penalties for early withdraw


## Stablecoins

    and to secure the . The DAO's mission is to provide a decentralized, trustless, and liquid staking solution for Ethereum 2.0. The DAO's values include transparency, community governance, and sustainability.

   The DAO's mission and values can help guide the treasury investment strategy. For example, if the DAO is focused on long-term sustainability, the treasury strategy may prioritize low-risk, stable yield-generating assets. If the DAO is more growth-oriented, it may be more open to higher-risk, higher-reward strategies.

   The DAO's mission and values can also help determine the types of assets or projects the treasury should support. For example, if the DAO is focused on supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, the treasury may prioritize investments in DeFi protocols or tokens.

   The DAO's mission and values can also help determine the governance structure for the treasury. For example, if the DAO values transparency and community input, the treasury may be governed by a decentralized governance process that allows token holders to vote on investment decisions.

   The DAO's mission and values can also help determine the risk tolerance for the treasury. For example, if the DAO is risk-averse, the treasury may prioritize low-risk, stable yield-generating assets. If the DAO is more risk-tolerant, it may be more open to higher-risk, higher-reward strategies.

   Overall, the DAO's mission and values should guide the treasury investment strategy to ensure that it aligns with the DAO's goals and objectives.
