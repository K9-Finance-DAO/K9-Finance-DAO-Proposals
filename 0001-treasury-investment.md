# **K9 Treasury Investment Proposal**

# Summary

# Objective

## Primary: Dual-Mandate
1. Utilize (currently unproductive) assets held in the DAO treasury to earn passive yield through in DeFi strategies.
2. Align with the K9 Finance DAO brand story: "liquid staking derivatives"

## Secondary:
1. Create risk profile and reduce risk
2. Diversification
3. Short-term and long-term

1. **DAO's Mission and Values**:
   What are the mission and core values of K9 Finance?
   Understanding the DAO's goals can help align the proposal with its overall strategy and ethos.

2. **Current Treasury Composition**:
   What does the current asset composition of the treasury look like?
   Knowing the starting point can help in suggesting how to allocate or re-allocate assets for yield generation.

3. **Risk Appetite**:
   What is the DAO's risk tolerance?
   Different yield strategies come with varying levels of risk, from the relatively stable yields
   of some liquidity pools to the more volatile or complex strategies associated with certain yield-bearing assets.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   How liquid does the DAO need its treasury to be?
   Some strategies may lock up assets or make them less readily available, which could be a consideration depending on the DAO’s cash flow needs.

5. **Governance and Decision-making**:
   How does the DAO currently make decisions regarding treasury management?
   Understanding the governance structure could influence how the proposal is framed to align with existing processes.

6. **Previous Experiences and Preferences**:
   Has the DAO previously engaged in similar yield-generating strategies?
   Learning from past experiences or preferences can guide the proposal towards more favorable options.

7. **Regulatory Considerations**:
   Are there any regulatory considerations or constraints that the DAO is mindful of when engaging in yield-generating activities?

8. **Technical Capabilities**:
   Does the DAO have or need specific technical capabilities or partnerships to implement and manage these strategies?

My thoughts on where we should put the treasury is two fold:
1. One is making money
2. The other is brand story.
3.
4. Our brand story is that we’re big on Lido and liquid staking. So we should walk the walk there. But I’m sure we can also take some more risk with curve as well maybe their 3pool on Curve for stables

Requirements for Treasury Plan Proposal:

- Steps (swap ETH into Lido for example)
- Yield farming opportunity
- Stablecoins on Convex / Aura 
- Timeline 
- Expected yield, any lockups, what process redeeming
- Why we're using this, other treasuries that use this 
- How we are removing smart contract risk, but what risks are there 
- Amount we're going to be using, how this fits into our overall budgeting, are there any penalties for early withdraw


## Stablecoins
