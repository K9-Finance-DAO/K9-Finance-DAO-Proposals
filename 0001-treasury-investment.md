# **K9 Treasury Investment Proposal**

# Summary

# Objective

## Primary: Dual-Mandate
1. Utilize (currently unproductive) assets held in the DAO treasury to earn passive yield through in DeFi strategies.
2. Align with the K9 Finance DAO brand story: "liquid staking derivatives" with a focus on Lido.

## Secondary:
1. Create risk profile and reduce risk
2. Diversification & risk management
3. Short-term and long-term
4. Decentralization and censorship resistance
5. Promote the growth of the Shibarium ecosystem, BONE token, SHIB token, and DeFi protocols on Shibarium.

1. **DAO's Mission and Values**:
   What are the mission and core values of K9 Finance?
   Understanding the DAO's goals can help align the proposal with its overall strategy and ethos.

2. **Current Treasury Composition**:
   The DAO treasury currently holds approximately $1,000,000 in a mix of assets:
   - 45% Ether (ETH)
   - 45% stablecoins (USDC and USDT)
   - 10% Other (BONE and SHIB tokens)


3. **Risk Appetite**:
   The DAO is very risk averse. Over time, through this proposal and subsequent treasury management proposals, the DAO will be able to build a risk profile, risk categories with target investment weights, risk evaluation criteria and monitoring processes, and criteria for balancing treasury investments to meet the DAO's risk tolerance.

   For the initial treasury investment proposal, the DAO will focus on low-risk, stable yield-generating assets and battle-tested DeFi strategies.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   Liquidity needs are low. The DAO does not have immediate cash flow needs and can afford to lock up some of its treasury assets in yield-generating strategies; however, the DAO should maintain a portion of its treasury in liquid assets to cover operational expenses and unforeseen circumstances.

   For the initial treasury investment proposal, the DAO will focus only on highly liquid assets or strategies that allow for quick redemption. Future proposals may consider longer lock-up periods for higher yield opportunities.

4. **Governance and Decision-making**:
   The DAO currently makes decisions regarding treasury management through a decentralized governance process, where token holders can vote on proposals. The treasury investment proposal will be submitted as a governance proposal for token holders to vote on.

5. **Previous Experiences and Preferences**:
   No. The DAO has not previously engaged in yield-generating strategies. This is the first treasury investment proposal for the DAO.

6. **Regulatory Considerations**:
   The DAO is based in Panama and is subject to Panamanian laws and regulations. The DAO will comply with all applicable laws and regulations when engaging in yield-generating activities; however, our legal team has advised that the DAO is not subject to any specific regulatory constraints that would prevent it from engaging in DeFi strategies.

7. **Technical Capabilities**:
   The DAO has an elected management council that oversees treasury management. This team has members with high levels of technical expertise and long history of combining DeFi strategies to create complex yield boosting strategies. We are very competent.

1. **DAO's Mission and Values**:

   1. Generate passive yield on the DAO's treasury assets through DeFi strategies.
   2. Align with the K9 Finance DAO brand story: "liquid staking derivatives" with a focus on Lido.
   3. Create risk profile and reduce risk.
   4. Grow the Shibarium ecosystem, attract users and TVL, promote the growth of DeFi on Shibarium, and help grow value for the BONE token, SHIB token, and DeFi protocols on Shibarium.

   ## Background on K9 Finance DAO
   The DAO's core product is a Liquid Staking Derivative of the BONE token: **knBONE**. BONE is the primary token, powering the Shibarium blockchain. Shibarium is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain that is fully compatible with Ethereum. BONE is used as the gas token to pay for Shibarium transactions, as well as used to secure the proof-of-stake (PoS) network through validator staking and delegation.

   Liquid staking derivatives have become a core foundational element of the DeFi ecosystem and are a fundamental element for modern PoS blockchains. They unlock liquidity, creating yield-bearing assets (YB assets) that can further be used in DeFi protocols, while still helping secure the blockchain through delegated staking. 
   
   The K9 Finance DAO is working to bring this fundamental DeFi building block to the Shibarium L2:
   - increasing the security of the network
   - increasing the utility of the BONE token
   - providing a new DeFi primitive, knBONE, to the broader DeFi ecosystem 
   - driving the adoption of Shibarium and BONE
   - driving the growth of DeFi protocols on Shibarium
   

2. **Current Treasury Composition**:
   What does the current asset composition of the treasury look like?
   Knowing the starting point can help in suggesting how to allocate or re-allocate assets for yield generation.

3. **Risk Appetite**:
   What is the DAO's risk tolerance?
   Different yield strategies come with varying levels of risk, from the relatively stable yields
   of some liquidity pools to the more volatile or complex strategies associated with certain yield-bearing assets.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   How liquid does the DAO need its treasury to be?
   Some strategies may lock up assets or make them less readily available, which could be a consideration depending on the DAO’s cash flow needs.

5. **Governance and Decision-making**:
   How does the DAO currently make decisions regarding treasury management?
   Understanding the governance structure could influence how the proposal is framed to align with existing processes.

6. **Previous Experiences and Preferences**:
   Has the DAO previously engaged in similar yield-generating strategies?
   Learning from past experiences or preferences can guide the proposal towards more favorable options.

7. **Regulatory Considerations**:
   Are there any regulatory considerations or constraints that the DAO is mindful of when engaging in yield-generating activities?

8. **Technical Capabilities**:
   Does the DAO have or need specific technical capabilities or partnerships to implement and manage these strategies?

My thoughts on where we should put the treasury is two fold:
1. One is making money
2. The other is brand story.
3.
4. Our brand story is that we’re big on Lido and liquid staking. So we should walk the walk there. But I’m sure we can also take some more risk with curve as well maybe their 3pool on Curve for stables

Requirements for Treasury Plan Proposal:

- Steps (swap ETH into Lido for example)
- Yield farming opportunity
- Stablecoins on Convex / Aura 
- Timeline 
- Expected yield, any lockups, what process redeeming
- Why we're using this, other treasuries that use this 
- How we are removing smart contract risk, but what risks are there 
- Amount we're going to be using, how this fits into our overall budgeting, are there any penalties for early withdraw


## Stablecoins

   The DAO's mission and values can help guide the treasury investment strategy. For example, if the DAO is focused on long-term sustainability, the treasury strategy may prioritize low-risk, stable yield-generating assets. If the DAO is more growth-oriented, it may be more open to higher-risk, higher-reward strategies.

   The DAO's mission and values can also help determine the types of assets or projects the treasury should support. For example, if the DAO is focused on supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, the treasury may prioritize investments in DeFi protocols or tokens.

   The DAO's mission and values can also help determine the governance structure for the treasury. For example, if the DAO values transparency and community input, the treasury may be governed by a decentralized governance process that allows token holders to vote on investment decisions.

   The DAO's mission and values can also help determine the risk tolerance for the treasury. For example, if the DAO is risk-averse, the treasury may prioritize low-risk, stable yield-generating assets. If the DAO is more risk-tolerant, it may be more open to higher-risk, higher-reward strategies.

   Overall, the DAO's mission and values should guide the treasury investment strategy to ensure that it aligns with the DAO's goals and objectives.
